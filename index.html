            <h1>Dear Yasmine,</h1>
            <p>
              Happy birthday!! Since you always make sure everyone gets the
              cutest most customized cards, we thought you should get one that
              you can keep forever,
              <span class="strike">handmade</span> handcoded, just for you.
              Please excuse any layout lousiness, I'll keep fixing the website
              as I get better at this hehe. As you turn 21, I hope you realize
              how loved and appreciated you are. I love you and miss you so
              muchüíôüíôüíô, <br />Sarah

            <h1>heyoooo yazzz ü¶Ñü¶Ñü¶Ñ</h1>
            <p>
              you're kinda old now like 21 is the age where you're no longer a
              kid but you're still a child and you'll always be a year younger
              :). i'll never forget CW4 when I met you, i was talking to no one
              other than you which is weird af but i didn't find anyone
              comforting to talk to. it was either i talk to you or i go on my
              phone. traces of that did carry on throughout the years as you
              have always been the best person to talk to and you always find
              the best ways to respond to anything i say. ik this year was rough
              at times but i hope we can look ahead into our friendship and only
              learn from what happened. you are one of the few people i know
              that would not hesitate to put others first before yourself. i
              really wish i can show you how much i appreciate you from my point
              of view and i am definitely not speaking only for myself. your
              friends do want to be around you. they do want to hang out with
              you. and it's because your company feels the closest to the heart.
              no they dont have to or are forced to be around you. your
              existence brings joy to the people that truly care. if the right
              people are around you, your happiness makes them happy. with one
              more year going by, i hope that the idea that your friends are
              there for you is strengthened. everyone has a birthday cry and
              that is fine. you are capable of going through shit even if you
              want to go through it alone, you have to know that your friends
              are with you even if not physically. and if you dont want to go
              through it alone, we'll go through the shit with you bitch. love
              you. aim to better yourself by the day. if you set goals for
              yourself for this year, dont try to accomplish the larger
              year-long goal, but set smaller sub-goals on a daily and weekly
              scale to help you get there. i want to say this again as a
              reminder that as long as my phone is not dead, im a phone call
              away, even if the call is just for me to check my phone and see
              that you need something. i will always be there for you when im
              not physically close. and when i am, you know i can see you
              anytime you need me, regardless of the circumstances you think im
              going through. trust that your friends will be there for you when
              you need them. The silent zoom calls. The sleepless nights
              talking. Staying up till sunrise. Trying to fix our shit ass
              sleep. My best moments from this year were with you. dont
              underestimate your worth in people's lives. you are a gem. no one
              even comes close to your love and kindness and care. although the
              world is a shithole, stick to what you believe in and what you
              believe you should be doing. every once in a while, even though it
              is hard, put yourself first. fuck everyone else and take care of
              your mind and body. you deserve every second of that. youre a
              queen. act like it bitch. <br />With love, <br />Jacky

              I would like to take this #occasion to thank you for your
              friendship, grace, and heart. I don‚Äôt know how we went from
              sitting awkwardly sitting in silence in Scandar‚Äôs class to you
              being one of my favorite people on Earth but I am very grateful
              that we did. today and every day I would like to remind you that
              you are the coolest, loveliest, and kindest. and also just a whole

              Happiest birthday to the kindest soul out there. Thank you for being a mom figure for all of your friends on campus and especially us your roommates. In a such short period of time you made me feel home, you are always there for everyone even when they don‚Äôt deserve it you carry everyone around you and you don‚Äôt wait for anything in return. Thank you for making our suite my home away from home, whether I was having a shitty day or a good one as soon as I come in the suite and close the door I would feel safe and more content as if I was back home with my family. Even though I‚Äôve never showed it before but I‚Äôm dreading the fact that I won‚Äôt be seeing you for a whole year, even if sometimes days pass by and I don‚Äôt see you on campus, but I know that you are there in your cozy room and you are by my side.
               Even though I don‚Äôt wanna leave university but I can‚Äôt wait for senior year so the 4 of us can be together again one family living together and making memories that will last forever. 
               Make the best out of NYC, try everything, be adventurous and try everything because you deserve this and all the good in the world. 
               Always remember that I‚Äôm here for you even if we don‚Äôt talk everyday, I‚Äôll be by your side through it all. I love you pineappleüíõ <br> -Rawya
